## Thonny log analysis

* Log files (generated by the IDE Thonny) analysis previously collected during a course of programming in Python.
* Identified most common novice programming mistakes and patterns.
* The aim was to correlate the behavior (common errors, coding skills, etc.) of students during the programming exercises activity with their results in the final test.
* The result of this work was the main subject of my master's thesis.
